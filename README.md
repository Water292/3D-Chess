This is an application for star trek style 3D Chess that I created as a project for an introductory programming class. 

This application allows the player to play against another player or against the computer. It also has a Tutorial mode, in which when you click on a piece, it shows all possible moves the piece can make. This makes it easier for people to learn the game and the ways in which it differs from regular chess.

Libraries:
tkinter - for graphics
random- to select from a given set of moves while computer generating moves

To install and run:
If you have python 3, running the program is all that is required.
